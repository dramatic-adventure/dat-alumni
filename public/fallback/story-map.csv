We stayed in touch, and I had the privilege of mentoring him as he transitioned into stand-up comedy—a path he embraced with heart, insight, and disarming humor. Clive rose to become one of Zimbabwe’s most powerful comedic voices, using laughter to speak truth in the face of political and social hardship. Even as he battled cancer, he remained a source of light—choosing joy, lifting others, and never backing down from telling the truth. His legacy lives on in the positivity, courage, and laughter he brought to so many.",I'm just too happy.,"Clive Chigubu, Student Actor",https://youtu.be/_d3SsUwDwdU?si=wJWKotmH0d9pSjcY,Jesse Baxter,jesse-baxter,https://youtu.be/_d3SsUwDwdU?si=wJWKotmH0d9pSjcY,Zimbabwe,Africa,,YES,Jesse Baxter|jesse@dramaticadventure.com,https://stories.dramaticadventure.com/story/my-name-is-clive,my-name-is-clive
